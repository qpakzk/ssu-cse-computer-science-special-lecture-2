# Deep Learning

This repository is source code for 컴퓨터공학특강2, which is a class opened in School of Computer Science & Engineering at Soongsil University in the fall of 2018.

The topic of this class is Deep Learning. Before studying Deep Learning, I learned the essentials of Python grammar and libraries, and Machine Learning for understanding Deep Learning. And finally I learned the basics of Deep Learning.

There exist lots of frameworks for Machine Learning and Deep Learning like [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch), [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team), [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and so on. They are convenient to implement fast. But it is hard to understand Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, because the frameworks support blackbox APIs.

So in this class, for understanding Machine Learning and Deep Learning well, don't use frameworks, but implement algorithms using python. For more information, you can find it in [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcCaSBJpsHk).

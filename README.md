# Computer Science Special Lecture 2

This repository is an archive of materials of Computer Science Special Lecture 2, which is opened in School of Computer Science & Engineering at Soongsil University in the fall of 2018.

In Computer Science Special Lecture 2, the topic is basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. There exist lots of frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch), [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team), [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and so on. They are convenient to implement fast. But it is hard to understand algorithms, because the frameworks support blackbox APIs.

So in this class, for understanding Machine Learning and Deep Learning well, don't use frameworks, but implement algorithms using python. For more information, you can find it in [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZAkjFAaT9gZk-nol6EIX9w).
